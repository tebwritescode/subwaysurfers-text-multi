## 1. Memory Usage Analysis

### 1.1 Baseline Memory Measurements

| Component | Memory Usage (MB) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Python Startup | 38.0 | Minimal Python overhead |
| Basic Imports | 192.6 | NumPy, requests, basic libraries |
| Audio Libraries | 193.3 | SoundFile added |
| FastAPI Framework | 206.8 | Complete web framework |

**Key Insight**: The baseline overhead before any TTS models is approximately **207 MB**, primarily from FastAPI and supporting libraries.

### 1.2 Mock Server Performance

The mock server implementation shows excellent memory efficiency:

- **Peak Usage**: 207.5 MB
- **Memory Growth**: 0.6 MB during voice generation cycles
- **Stability**: Extremely stable (0.2 MB standard deviation)
- **Scaling**: Linear and predictable

**Mock Generation Cycle Results**:
```
Generation 0: 207.5 MB (generate) → 207.5 MB (encode) → 207.5 MB (cleanup)
Generation 1: 207.5 MB (generate) → 207.5 MB (encode) → 207.5 MB (cleanup)
...
```

This demonstrates that the current architecture effectively manages memory during audio generation cycles.

### 1.3 PyTorch Server (Mock Mode) Analysis

When testing with actual HTTP requests to the mock PyTorch server:

- **Baseline**: 207.5 MB
- **Peak Usage**: 211.6 MB
- **Request Growth**: 4.1 MB total for 3 synthesis requests
- **Per-Request Average**: ~210 MB

**Request Analysis**:
| Request | Text Length | Audio Duration | Memory Usage |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Short | 10 words | 0.8s | 209.0 MB |
| Medium | 17 words | 6.3s | 209.4 MB |
| Long | 42 words | 16.4s | 211.6 MB |

**Observation**: Memory usage scales moderately with text length and audio duration.

## 3. Performance Optimization Strategies

### 3.1 Current Implementation Strengths

1. **Lazy Loading**: Heavy libraries are imported only when needed
2. **Memory Cleanup**: Proper garbage collection after audio generation
3. **Efficient Architecture**: FastAPI with minimal overhead
4. **Stable Memory Pattern**: Very low variance in memory usage

### 3.2 Optimization Opportunities

#### For Mock Implementation:
- ✅ Already optimized - minimal memory footprint
- ✅ Excellent memory stability
- ✅ Proper cleanup cycles

#### For Real Bark Implementation:

1. **Model Loading Strategies**
   - **Lazy Loading**: Load models only when first requested
   - **CPU Offloading**: Use `SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU=True` for systems with <8GB GPU
   - **Small Model Option**: Use `suno/bark-small` for resource-constrained environments

2. **Memory Management**
   - **Model Caching**: Implement LRU cache for frequently used models
   - **Memory Limits**: Set strict Docker memory limits with OOM handling
   - **Batch Processing**: Group multiple requests to amortize model loading costs

3. **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**
   ```python
   # Current implementation already includes:
   if not torch.cuda.is_available() or torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory < 8e9:
       os.environ["SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU"] = "True"
   ```

### 3.3 Recommended Configuration

For the current codebase (`pytorch-tts-server/app.py`):

```python
# Memory optimization settings
SUPPORTED_MODELS = {
    "suno/bark-small": {  # Prioritize small model for production
        "type": "bark_small",
        "memory_optimized": True
    }
}

# Environment variables for memory efficiency
os.environ["SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS"] = "True"
os.environ["SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU"] = "True"  # For systems with <8GB GPU
```

## 5. Scaling Strategies

### 5.1 Vertical Scaling (Single Instance)

**Current Analysis**:
- **Memory per Request**: ~210 MB
- **Estimated Concurrent Requests**: 39 (on 8GB system)
- **Scaling Pattern**: Variable (depends on text length)

**Recommendations**:
- Use connection pooling to limit concurrent requests
- Implement request queuing for high load
- Monitor memory usage with alerts at 80% capacity

### 5.2 Horizontal Scaling (Multiple Instances)

**For High Availability**:
```yaml
services:
  pytorch-tts:
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 4G
    placement:
      constraints:
        - node.role == worker
```

**Load Balancing Considerations**:
- Sticky sessions not required (stateless)
- Round-robin distribution works well
- Health checks on `/health` endpoint

### 5.3 Hybrid Approach

1. **Fast Lane**: Mock server for development/testing
2. **Quality Lane**: Real Bark for production content
3. **Auto-Scaling**: Based on queue depth and memory usage

---

## 6. Monitoring and Alerting

### 6.1 Key Metrics to Monitor

```yaml
memory_metrics:
  - rss_memory_mb
  - memory_growth_rate
  - request_memory_overhead
  - model_loading_time

performance_metrics:
  - synthesis_duration
  - queue_depth
  - error_rate
  - cache_hit_ratio
```

### 6.2 Alert Thresholds

- **Memory Usage**: Alert at 80% of container limit
- **Memory Growth**: Alert on >100MB growth in 5 minutes
- **Model Loading**: Alert if loading takes >60 seconds
- **Queue Depth**: Alert if >10 requests waiting
